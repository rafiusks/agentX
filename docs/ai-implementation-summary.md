- **Ambiguity Handling**: Multi-candidate intent resolution

**Example Usage**:
```rust
let ai_system = AISystem::new();
let commands = ai_system.process_query("create a new file called test.rs").await?;
// Generates: ["mkdir -p", "touch test.rs"]
```

### 2. Intelligent Command Suggestions

**Module**: `src/intelligence/suggestions.rs`

**Key Components**:
- **History Analyzer**: Tracks command frequency and recency
- **Context Detector**: Git-aware and project-specific suggestions
- **Pattern Matcher**: Common command patterns and variations
- **Workflow Predictor**: Multi-command sequence prediction

**Features**:
- Real-time suggestions based on partial input
- Confidence scoring combining multiple factors
- Workflow prediction for common sequences
- Keyboard shortcuts for frequent commands

### 3. Error Diagnosis and Recovery

**Module**: `src/intelligence/error_diagnosis.rs`

**Key Components**:
- **Error Classifier**: Pattern-based error type detection
- **Fix Suggester**: Context-aware fix generation
- **Learning System**: Records successful fixes for future use
- **Prevention Tips**: Proactive error prevention advice

**Supported Error Types**:
- Port conflicts (EADDRINUSE)
- Missing dependencies
- Compilation errors
- Permission issues
- Resource exhaustion

### 4. Context Management

**Module**: `src/intelligence/context.rs`

**Key Components**:
- **Directory Analyzer**: Project type and framework detection
- **Git Analyzer**: Repository state and history
- **Environment Detector**: Safe environment variable collection
- **Privacy Filter**: Automatic PII redaction

**Context Features**:
- Multi-repository workspace awareness
- Cross-project dependency detection
- Session memory for better assistance
- Privacy-preserving context sharing

### 5. Unified AI System

**Module**: `src/intelligence/mod.rs`

**Key Components**:
- **AISystem**: Coordinates all AI features
- **UserContext**: Tracks expertise for adaptive UI
- **Progressive Disclosure**: UI complexity based on usage

## Technical Architecture

### ML Model Recommendations

1. **NLP Model**: CodeT5+ (770M parameters)
   - Intent classification <100ms
   - 94% accuracy on code intents

2. **Command Ranking**: DistilBERT-based
   - Siamese network architecture
   - <10ms inference time

3. **Error Classification**: BERT-based
   - 150+ error categories
   - 91% accuracy

4. **Sequence Prediction**: GPT-2 Small
   - 78% next-command accuracy
   - Local inference with ONNX

### Performance Optimizations

- **Caching**: Multi-level cache for all predictions
- **Batching**: Process multiple requests together
- **Lazy Loading**: Load models only when needed
- **Quantization**: 8-bit models for 4x size reduction

### Privacy & Security

- **Local First**: All processing happens locally by default
- **Data Filtering**: Automatic removal of sensitive information
- **Audit Trail**: All data access logged
- **Sandboxing**: Isolated execution environments

## Usage Examples

### Running the Demo

```bash
cargo run --example ai_features_demo
```

### Integration Example

```rust
use agentx::intelligence::AISystem;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let ai = AISystem::new();
    
    // Natural language to commands
    let commands = ai.process_query("build and test the project").await?;
    
    // Get suggestions
    let suggestions = ai.get_suggestions("git").await;
    
    // Diagnose errors
    let diagnosis = ai.diagnose_error(error_output, &context).await?;
    
    // Build context
    let context = ai.build_context(&current_dir).await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Progressive Expertise System

The system tracks user interactions and adjusts UI complexity:
- 0-10 interactions: Beginner (Simple UI)
- 10-50 interactions: Intermediate (Power features)
- 50-100 interactions: Advanced (Pro mode)
- 100+ interactions: Expert (All features)

### 2. Context-Aware Processing

Commands are generated based on detected project type:
- Rust → `cargo test`, `cargo build`
- JavaScript → `npm test`, `npm run build`
- Python → `pytest`, `python setup.py build`

### 3. Learning from User Behavior

The system learns from:
- Command success/failure rates
- User corrections to suggestions
- Frequently used command sequences
- Error resolution patterns

### 4. Workflow Automation

Predefined workflows for common tasks:
- Git feature branch workflow
- NPM project initialization
- Docker build and deploy
- Test-driven development cycle

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1: Advanced ML Integration
- Fine-tuned code models
- Reinforcement learning from user feedback
- Multi-modal understanding (code + docs)

### Phase 2: Agent Orchestration
- Parallel agent execution
- Inter-agent communication
- Human approval workflows

### Phase 3: Distributed Intelligence
- Shared learning across users
- Community-driven patterns
- Privacy-preserving federation
