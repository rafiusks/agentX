## Notes

- **Priority Levels**: P0 = Must have for phase completion, P1 = Should have, P2 = Nice to have, P3 = Future enhancement
- **Dependencies**: Later phases depend on earlier ones - focus on Phase 0 first
- **Iteration**: Each phase should produce a working system that can be tested and improved
- **Community**: Engage early adopters throughout development for feedback
- **Open Source**: Maintain transparency with public roadmap and progress updates
