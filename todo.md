# AgentX Development Todo List

## Overview
Building the AI IDE for agentic software development - where AI agents do the building while humans do the thinking.

## üéâ Major Milestone: Phase 1 Base Layer Complete!

AgentX now has a fully functional LLM chat interface with:
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and Demo provider
- ‚úÖ **Streaming Responses**: Real-time token streaming for all providers
- ‚úÖ **Standalone Operation**: Works without any API keys via Demo provider
- ‚úÖ **Smart Fallback**: Automatically switches between providers
- ‚úÖ **Environment Detection**: Reads API keys from environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to demo mode in non-interactive terminals

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start the development environment
make dev

# Or run components separately:
# Start backend
cd agentx-backend && go run cmd/server/main.go

# Start frontend
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- **Priority Levels**: P0 = Must have for phase completion, P1 = Should have, P2 = Nice to have, P3 = Future enhancement
- **Dependencies**: Later phases depend on earlier ones - focus on Phase 0 first
- **Iteration**: Each phase should produce a working system that can be tested and improved
- **Community**: Engage early adopters throughout development for feedback
- **Open Source**: Maintain transparency with public roadmap and progress updates
